# Video Clip Motion Detection 

A jupyter notebook for simple motion detection from a folder of videos.

## Description

Want to detect if there's a rat running around in your house at night?
Anyone posessing a security camera would usually have to sift through hours of footage just to find the exact instance of the incident.
This project aims to solve exactly that problem by filtering out video clips with movement in them.

## Requirements

Opencv, numpy, matplotlib

## Usage

Just place your folder of videos into the directory and change the variable root_dir to match it.
